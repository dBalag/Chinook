# Chinook is a ficticious company in the music stream business.
-1st Step has been to check in SQL for Null Values and some of them have been found in Employee, Invoice, Customer & Track datasets.
Used G-Colab Python to fill these Null Values and download locally the cleaned files. File with code 1.Chinnok_Dataclean.

-Once data is clean i performed in Python: Exploratory, Univariate, Bivariate. Variance & Descriptive Analysis, alongside with Hypothesis Test.

-Moved back to SQL to answer some business questions using queries. File 8_Chinook_PostgreSQL_queries.sql
